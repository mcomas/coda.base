\description{
From Eurostat (the European Unionâ€™s statistical information service) the
houseexpend data set records the composition on proportions of mean
consumption expenditure of households expenditures on 12 domestic year
costs in 27 states of the European Union. Some values in the data set are
rounded zeros. In addition the data set contains the gross domestic
product (GDP05) and (GDP14) in years 2005 and 2014, respectively. An
interesting analysis is the potential association between expenditures
compositions and GDP. Once a linear regression model is established,
predictions can be provided.
