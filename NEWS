coda.base 0.4.2
===============
* Pairwise default name changed to lr instead of alr.
* Sparse matrices are used for basis when zeros.
* Problem with constrained principal balances detected and solved.

coda.base 0.3.2 (Release date: 2022-03-13)
===============
* `coord()` and `comp()` are included as a shorter names of `coordinates()` and `composition()`.
* Basis names taken from composition.
* Coordinates based on pairwise log-ratios available with `pairwise_basis()` or basis = 'pw' in function coordinates().
* Parameter label removed in function coordinates().

coda.base 0.3.1
===============
* PB constrained approximation available. Adaptation of code provided by J.A.Martín-Fernández.
