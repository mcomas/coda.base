#' Chemical compositions of Romano-British pottery
#' @description
#' The pottery data set consists of data pertaining to the chemical composition of 45
#' specimens of Romano-British pottery. The method used to generate these data is
#' atomic absorption spectophotometry, and readings for nine oxides
#' (Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2 , MnO, BaO) are provided. These samples come
#' from five different kiln sites.

#' Household budget patterns
#' @description
#' In a sample survey of single persons living alone in rented accommodation, twenty
#' men and twenty women were randomly selected and asked to record over a period of
#' one month their expenditures on the following four mutually exclusive and
#' exhaustive commodity groups:
#' * Hous: Housing, including fuel and light.
#' * Food: Foodstuffs, including alcohol and tobacco.
#' * Serv: Services, including transport and vehicles.
#' * Other: Other goods, including clothing, footwear and durable goods.

#' Food consumption in European countries
#'
#' The alimentation data set contains the percentages of consumption of several
#' types of food in 25 European countries during the 80s. The categories are:
#' * RM: red meat (pork, veal, beef),
#' * WM: white meat (chicken),
#' * E: eggs,
#' * M: milk,
#' * F: fish,
#' * C: cereals,
#' * S: starch (potatoes),
#' * N: nuts, and
#' * FV: fruits and vegetables.
#'
#' Moreover, the dataset contains a categorical variable that
#' shows if the country is from the North or a Southern Mediterranean country. In
#' addition, the countries are classified as Eastern European or as Western European.

#' The MN blood system
#' @description
#'
#' \loadmathjax
#' In humans the main blood group systems are the ABO system, the Rh system and
#' the MN system. The MN blood system is a system of blood antigens also related
#' to proteins of the red blood cell plasma membrane. The inheritance pattern of the
#' MN blood system is autosomal with codominance, a type of lack of dominance in
#' which the heterozygous manifests a phenotype totally distinct from the homozygous.
#' The possible phenotypical forms are three blood types: type M blood, type
#' N blood and type MN blood. The frequencies of M, N and MN blood types vary
#' widely depending on the ethnic population. However, the Hardy-Weinberg
#' principle states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will
#' remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other
#' evolutionary influences. This implies that, in the long run, it holds that
#'
#' \mjeqn{\frac{x_{MM}x_{NN}}{x_{MN}} = \frac{1}{4}}{ (x_MM x_NN) / x_MN = 1/4}
#'
#'where xM M and xN N are the genotype relative frequencies of MM and NN
#'homozygotes, respectively, and xM N is the genotype relative frequency
#'of MN heterozygotes. This principle was named after G.H. Hardy and W.
#' Weinberg demonstrated it mathematically.
